      <Title>API - Cloud Block</Title>
      <Body>
        Cloud blocks represent immutable values in the database. The value
        cannot be changed, but a cloud block may exist in the client before the
        data has been loaded. Blocks may also exist in the client before they
        have been published to the source.
      </Body>
      <Section title="Usage">
        <Body>
          Client-side blocks should always be retrieved from a{' '}
          <Link routeName="API-CloudDoc">cloud doc</Link>, which in turn are
          retrieved by the <Link routeName="API-CloudClient">cloud client</Link>
          . For example:
        </Body>
        <Snippet
          code={`
import createCloudClient from "@aven-cloud/cloud/createCloudClient";

const cloud = createCloudClient({ source });
const doc = cloud.get("MyDocName");

const block = doc.getBlock(); // gets the current block referenced by the doc
`}
        />
        <Body>From a doc, there are multiple ways to access a block:</Body>
        <Snippet
          code={`
// gets the current block referenced by the doc
const block = doc.getBlock();

// gets a block from the doc, identified by id 
const block = doc.getBlock('somedatachecksum');

// gets the a block with a reference object
const blockRef = { type: 'BlockReference', id: 'somedatachecksum' };
const block = doc.getBlock(blockRef);
