      <Body>
        Cloud docs are named client-side references to data. They support
        transactions and provide high-level functionality for observing and
        mutating data on the client, which will by syncronized to the upstream{' '}
        <Link routeName="Spec-Source">source</Link>. Each doc lives in the
        domain specified by the cloud client.

        <Body>
          Client-side docs are retrieved from the{' '}
          <Link routeName="API-CloudClient">cloud client</Link>. For example:
        </Body>
        <Snippet
          code={`
import createCloudClient from "@aven-cloud/cloud/createCloudClient";

const cloud = createCloudClient({ source });
const doc = cloud.get("MyDoc");
`}
        />
        <Body>From there, data can be saved:</Body>
        <Snippet
          code={`
await doc.put({ my: 'data' });

// now the new data will be available with doc.getValue()
`}
        />
        <Body>
          Those observing the same doc can see the data as it changes:
        </Body>
        <Snippet
          code={`
doc.observeValue.subscribe({
  next: value => {
    console.log("value here will be {my: 'data'}");

        <SubSection title="Doc Children">
          <Body>
            Docs can have children which are accessed with a slash in the name,
            or by calling ".get" on the parent doc:
          </Body>
          <Snippet
            code={`
const parent = cloud.get('MyDoc');

const child = cloud.get('MyDoc/Details');

// which is equivalent to:
const child = parent.get('Details');
`}
          />
          <Body>
            Children documents are deleted when the parent is deleted.
            Permissions applied to the parent affect the child as well. Of
            course children can be arbitrarily deep.
